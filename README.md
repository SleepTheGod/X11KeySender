"X11KeySender" is a versatile utility script leveraging the X11 library to simulate keyboard input on Unix-based systems. This tool enables users to send specific key combinations, regular keys, and special characters to a target window or application through a command-line interface. It facilitates automation and streamlines processes by emulating keyboard actions, making it particularly useful for testing, automation tasks, or custom scripting where simulated keyboard inputs are required. The script incorporates error handling to detect and report invalid keys or special characters, ensuring a smoother execution and enhancing reliability in key event simulation.
